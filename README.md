# Subatomic 

Subatomic is the world's minimalistic JS framework

 - **No unnecessary features**: Subatomic does not contain nor never will contain bloatware or any non-necessary features. 
 -  **Small and Features-Rich**: Subatomic is very small and versatile while having important features like Server Side Rendering
 - **Component-Based**:  Subatomic allows you to write once and use that component anywhere without copy & pasting or creating messy code.

## Getting Started

You can create a new subatomic app by running:

    npx create-subatomic-app@latest
    # or
    yarn create subatomic-app
    # or
    pnpm create subatomic-app
    # or
    bunx create-subatomic-app

After run subatomic by running:
